# INST377-Final-Project
Hello! This is our Final Project for INST377 Section 0104 by Diamond Andy and Sam Lesiga!
Our goal for our project is to present a website that allows users to compare salaries across agencies, providing insights into pay disparities and highlighting the distribution of earnings for different roles.
The API we will be using is the Philadelphia City Employee Earnings API: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/city-employee-earnings/resource/e7f2178e-9714-4e8e-b099-dc7f523041d1
